        - Creating a strategy
        - Communicating
        - Coordinating development
        - Responding to fires

    - Which in turn, allows them to strategically answer important questions:
        - What are we building?
        - Who are we building this for?
        - Why are we solving this problem? / Why are we building this specific solution?
        - When are we building this?
    - Product Management plays an important role in connecting and aligning all the relevant teams needed to build and launch a product.
    - Product Managers identify and define problems for the team to solve while making sure that:
        - the problem is real
        - the users are real
        - the solution provides value

                - Write a PRD - Problem Frame the problem: Describe the opportunity. What are the benefits to the user? What are key insights? What does the competition do? Why does this matter?
                - Write a PRD - Goals What are the product goals: What does success look like? How do you measure success?
                - Write a PRD - Key feature requirements What should the product do? How should each feature be prioritized?

                        - P0 - Support for multiple alarms (at least 10)
                        - P0 - Alarm management - edit and delete existing alarms
                        - P0 - Alarm goes off at designated time
                        - P0 - Snooze active alarm
                        - P0 - Turn off active alarm
                        - P1 - Customizable alarm tones

                        - P1 - ‚ÄúSilent alarm‚Äù that vibrates only
                - Exercise Build a Roadmap TODO
                    - Now that you‚Äôve written a PRD for your alarm clock app, you need to break the features out into a roadmap. Break out the roadmap into 4 quarters. Don‚Äôt worry too much about the specific sizing‚Ä¶ Instead focus on things that should be built together and what order those things should be built in.
                    - List out features on the roadmap that should be built in Q1. Make sure to include your rationale for why these features should be built during this timeframe.
