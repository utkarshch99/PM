    - Total Addressable Market
        - `TAM = Average revenue per user X total number of potential users in the market`
        - Approaches to calculating TAM:
            - Top Down
                - You start with a high level view of the economy, and then narrow that down based on factors like demographics. For example, you usually will start will everyone in the world and narrow down that audience to people who are interested in your product.
            - Bottoms Up
                - This involves using known data points that you have (data from early customers and sales) that you could extrapolate to represent a larger market opportunity. For example, if you are already selling a product in one region and were considering selling it globally.
            - Value Theory
                - Generally used for new product categories where you don’t have much information to base estimates on. This involves conducting market research to understand how much people would pay for your product and how many potential customers you have.

    - [ROI](<ROI.md>)
        - $$\frac{(impact ~-~ amount~~ spent)}{amount ~~spent}$$
        - Payback period:
            - the amount of time that it takes to regain the initial cost of buildinng the product
            - $$\frac{cost} {payback~~per~ year}$$
    - Creating and Evaluating Hypotheses
        - Create hypotheses to make sure that your assumptions about your product are correct -- and that you are solving a real problem for real people.
        - Customer Need
            - is this a real problem
            - painkiller vs. vitamin
        - Your solution
            - does it really solve the problem
            - what alternatives does the customer have?
            - is solution way better?
        - Differentiation
            - is it different?
            - how is it different, what does it do that others didn't
        - Value
            - does this solution create enough value for the user that they are willing to pay for it
            - how much will people play for it
            - what can you do to increase willingness to pay
            - how much are they paying for current alternatives
        - Evaluation a hypothesis
            - ways:
                - User Interviews
                - Focus groups
                - Surveys
                - Design sprint
            - show mocks, prototypes
            - take help of researcher to do with minimal bias
        - If you find that:
            - You are not addressing a customer need
            - Your solution isn’t providing value
            - Your product isn’t differentiated enough
            - There’s no willingness to pay…
            - **Stop**. It’s not worth pursuing this idea in its current form because you won’t have product/market fit. You should go back and tweak which customer you are focusing on… or your solution.. Or pricing model.

                To speak in numbers, considering just type 2 diabetes which is affecting 10 percent of our citizens and costing a whoppping amount of 330 billion dollars
                buuuuttt with proper physical activity we can lower **46%** cases and we could save 12 billion dollars per year considering only with diabetes. **(__next slide__)**

                imagine an app which monitors your whole health, warns you of any dangers, suggests you of necessary actions, lets to ask quick help from your physicians, connects with every member, inspires you to take action. 
                That's the app we are proposing to improve the health of our members
            - {{word-count}}
                To build such a fully featured app, it would cost us an investment of 50 thousand dollars and extra for monthly updates and maintainence
                but when its compared to the impact even if just 10% of our members used and quarter of them on a streak of achieving goals we can save around 600 million dollars per year, that is ... returns on investment would 400%
            - {{word-count}}
                We will know if we have reached our Kaiser permanente mission to improve health by keeping track of metrics like daily active user, users feedback and rating, growth of number of installs and how many them are achieving their prescribed goals

                This domain is not completely new and we have a few competitors focusing on various features 
                main category of competitors would be social fitness apps like strava and runtastic which focus on network effect to gain new users and subscriptions for revenues. Strava.... which currently tops the chart has 50 million users
                they also include various free and premium features for tracking, visually analysing and measuring achievements.

                though they were found of little use to improve health.... they provide accurate metrics of vital signals and are able to track many types of activities, also providing visual dashboards and useful guides
            - {{word-count}}
                well we have to provide whole these features with our value propositions, thanks to 20 thousand KP physicians instead of AI based support we can provide unique assistance to all our members
                we will not only be just showing the dashboards but also useful insights on thier performance
                we can use existing network of researchers to establish a direct communication channel  and provide useful notifications
                we would be providing all the essential features ad free for 12 million KP registered members which will boost our network effect with rockets
            - {{word-count}}
                the vision for the roadmap to achieve our goals is: .... to build an app that completely cares about the well being of users, prevents them from adverse conditions before suffering. the strategy will be to start by providing essentia features, via the MVP to needy patients suggested by doctors, next launching with the social community and all other useful features to our members and public and then providing connectivity to the in-house doctors
            - {{word-count}}
                for the first theme of physical activity assistance, features include trackability of all the metrics reagrding to various aspects of health , to analyse those metrics, show performance and suggest personalised targets based on hardness. these help the users to know where they stand and put efforts in a right and smart way. 
                by initial MVP we can get to know the actual painpoints and align regardingly
            - {{word-count}}
                now comes the most important theme for growth....... to create social effects, connect everyone having common goals, demographics so that they have accountability partners, 
                by having competitions, leaderboards, hall of fame and other gamified concepts users engagement will be improved not only from KP members but also other users across from the nation
            - {{word-count}}
                Final theme is to integrate all existing KP health system to provide periodical monitoring of more needy patients, curate personalized plans based on unique physical conditions, and ways for them to have quick chats and consultations from inside the app itself. 
                also All the staff will be giving important and useful updates for added motivation.
            - {{word-count}}
                - after achieving these milestones for the first year we can widen our scope by adding content of videos and audios for how tos, chatbots for common nutritional and health queries, support with popular wearables for accuracy and integrate artificial intelligence for early warning of potential health conditions with the data daily captured from apps and devices
            - {{word-count}}
                - So hope you like the product vision and pitch and consider this as good investment. Thanks.
    - Project Review: Meets Specifications
        __Dear @Siddish,__
        __Congratulations!! :tada: :tada:__
        __Excellent work! Your submission has passed all the rubric of this project. All the effort you put in to complete the project are very much appreciated and it was my pleasure reviewing your work. Your work has been hands-down one of the best projects that I have reviewed so far, all the details are immaculate and exceptional.__
        __You are good to go. Keep up the great work and good luck with future projects! [:muscle:]__
        __Hope my review and motivation helps you improve as you go on. Good luck for your future projects.__
        __Stay safe!__
        **Individual Section:**
            - Business Case
            - Have you outlined a problem worth solving? This isn’t just a fun product to build, it should be a product that solves someone’s pain.
            - Have you clearly articulated what that pain is? For example, in our sample project, we articulate the pain of “we are wasting 33 million a year in health care costs on diabetes care that could be saved”. That’s pain, and it’s pain that someone might be interested in solving.
                - Included specific metrics to back up your claim
                - Included potential cause(s)
                - Included a call to action that would resonate with stakeholders
            - __Fantastic work in identifying the problem space. The cause and effect details were explanied very well. ![:clap:]__
            - Have you quantified the size of the opportunity? It can’t be something as all-encompassing as “the market for diabetes treatment is $300B”.
            - What piece of this market are you approaching? How big is it? Why only this piece? TAM (Total Addressable Market) should usually be counted in billions. Anything with a B in front of it is probably a good TAM. That said, your focus area will have a return significantly lower than the total TAM.
            - Use links and sources where possible. This doesn’t need to be comprehensively footnoted, but quotes and numbers are always more believable when the source is mentioned
            - __Exceptional work in identifying the TAM for this project. Including a quote from the doctor was pretty impressive. It helps build an emotion towards the topic. Keep it up!__
            - State what you want to build. Give brief details at a high level of functionality, just enough for readers to understand the proposal
            - Have you outlined a clear solution to that problem? Will a reader or viewer understand what you’re proposing to build? It can’t be something vague like “I will build a marketplace!” It has to be specific. What kind of marketplace? What does it do? How is it special? What audience does it address?
            - __Clear and concise. Great stuff! ![:muscle:]__
            - What do you think this will cost? What do you think this will produce in terms of revenue or cost savings? What is the return on investment?
            - You don’t need to provide an extremely detailed business case here, that’s usually provided as supporting material. Detailed spreadsheets are often too brittle because they rely on numerous assumptions, any one of which being wrong will throw the entire ROI calculation off. Think simple calculations instead. X months of development * 10k each / some simple measure of return.
            - __Great job on your calculations. I like how it is broken down! Realistic ROI that every investor would like to see.__
            - How will you measure the success of your idea? What is the goal for the first year?
            - __Another impressive section, very well laid out. Here are a couple of resources that might aid you in the future for better value add to your project,__
            - [ ] https://www.bbntimes.com/companies/how-to-measure-the-success-of-your-business-idea
            - [ ] https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikekappel/2017/03/08/6-ways-to-measure-small-business-success/[6e5cb84218f4](<6e5cb84218f4.md>)
            - ### Competitors
            - Outline at least two competitors. Remember that these don’t need to be exact competitors but might be companies in the same general field. For example, YouTube competitors might be Amazon Video but they may also be traditional TV networks. You may want to highlight a category of competitors instead of a specific one (e.g. Traditional TV networks as opposed to NBC)
            - For each competitor give a brief overview of at least 4 features. Provide enough so that the audience can understand their offering.
            - __[ Wasn't given any verbal feedback, just green tick]__
            - Then follow this up with a slide outlining why your product is better. This slide should answer the question of “why us?” Why should a buyer choose your product as opposed to one of the competitors?
            - Remember that the best competitive advantages are ones that are hard for competitors to match. For example, network effects, unique business partnerships, and unique content are hard for competitors to match. Pricing is not.
            - __Couldn't agree with you more on this section. With the limited available public information, you've outlined great details. Kudos! ![:raised_hands:]__
            - ### Roadmap and Vision
            - **What is your vision?**
            - Is there a strategy behind the roadmap or is it simply a list of follow up items? A strategy means a goal. Provide at least 2 themes corresponding to the future strategy of the product.
            - For example, your strategy might be “expand into other geographical markets by investing in UI translations and regional specific features”.
            - __Hands-down the best section in your pitch. Loved seeing how realistically you've identified KP's strengths and put them into good use. You are a pro! [:smile:]__
            - For each strategic theme, provide two or three features that you want to develop for this theme along with a brief explanation on each.
            - The list of features on the roadmap should flow from your vision and strategies.
            - __Fantastic work, again! Ticked all the right boxes for me!__
            - ### Presentation & Delivery
            - Use the provided template and fill out the slides applicable to your product. Don’t try to invent a new process where one already exists. Don’t try to make what you’re doing “special”. Follow the process. In this case, we are providing you with a template. In real-life scenarios, you can find a template through other PM’s at your company. Don’t reinvent the wheel and don’t bring an unfamiliar template to your stakeholders if they’re used to information being presented a certain way. It’s distracting and will detract from your message.
            - Additionally, pay attention to the way that you craft your presentation. Visually, this also means the manner in which your slides are created. General rules for slides:
                - Each slide should have a key take away
                - Content on each slide should be focused on supporting the key takeaway
                    - A slide shouldn’t have more than 5 top-level bullets
                        - Each top-level bullet should not have more than 3 sub-bullets
                        - Each bullet or sub-bullet should not have more than one complete sentence. Preferably, each bullet or sub-bullet is just a sentence fragment
                - Formatting (font, sizes, etc) should be consistent. Be careful of text you copied and pasted into the presentation, it will frequently carry over its own formatting
                - Use at least 3 visuals (like graphs and images) when appropriate to make it easier to understand your message
            - __You've kept the deck plain and simple which is a great thing. Simplicity goes a long way in convincing people that your idea is neat and informed. Well done! ![:clap:]__
            - Create a video recording of yourself giving your presentation. You’ll want to make sure to do a screen capture of your slides, as well as the audio of you explaining each slide.
            - On a Mac, you can use QuickTime Player.
            - On a PC you can use the built-in Screen Recording Tool (Windows 10).
            - There are also many other free apps available for recording your screen and audio (including [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/))
            - Note: Make sure you are also capturing audio from your microphone
            - Remember, your presentation should be 10 minutes and no longer. Pitch presentations are usually short on time and you need to practice delivering your idea in a succinct manner.
            - Make sure that you have smooth transitions between all slides and topics.
            - Make sure you are able to speak to the idea instead of just reading off bullet points? You need to know your product. If it feels like you’re reading bullet points, people will lose confidence. And watch out for pauses (unless for dramatic effect)
            - Do you sound positive and confident when talking about your product idea? You are the cheerleader for your product. You are always positive about it. You always believe in it. If you don’t, no one will.
            - __Clear and confident pitch delivery, 10/10 for this!__
            - Use the three different types of persuasion when building and delivering your presentation:
                - Credibility
                    - Use and cite credible sources when appropriate (at least 2)
                - Emotion
                    - Include a message that makes your audience feel a specific way
                - Logic
                    - Present facts
            - __Lastly, fantastic job on using credible sources to back your facts!__
